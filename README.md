My page is currently composed of 3 pages: index.html (home), portfolio.html, and contact.html
There is a working navbar on the top. Clicking "Unity" will take you to the main/Home page. As will the home button.
Portfolio and Contact Nav Links will also take you to the corresponding pages.

The home page consists of a centered responsive image. I then put in a Header, followed by a row, containing 3 columns of text. There is another header, then a new row containing 2 columns

The portfolio page features a centered, responsive image. There is a header, followed by a row separated into 2 columns. I opted to use an "Image Figure" example from boot strap showing a basic web page layout with a caption below. Lorem text is used to fill in space in the column next to the image. I have another header and then 3 columns. the first 2 columns, i divided into 2 separate rows. and included another Responsive, Image Figure in the 3rd column.

Lastly, there is a contact page with a centered, responsive image. I then used a header and included a Form which collects Name, Email, Country (A list dropdown with 4 options ..., USA, CA, Other) and a location to uploade a Resume. Lastly there is a submit button at the bottom of the page.

Finally, I added a sticky footer to each page "Unity Coding Bootcamp"

Updated the "Submit" button. The button now clears the form.
